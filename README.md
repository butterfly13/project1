The Approach Taken
------------------


1. I first looked up on google what generanl ideas for hangman game
2. I then read the requirements of this project and it requires that there are 2 players for this game. Moreover, HTML, CSS and JavaScript files have to be seperated files.
3,  After I understand the requirements, I started planing by drawing the wireframe so that I know what my game page will look like.
4. Then I started the psuedo code, so I will know what to start coding and what comes first.
5. I then started with my HTML file according to my wireframe.
6. After I get my HTML file up, I included the js file and css file in the HTML file.
7. Then I started coding in my js file.
8. What I used for js file is function, DOM manipulation, eventListener, for loop and conditional statements
9. When I was coding, I refered to my logic step by stpe according to the psuedo code
10. I started one step at a time, so when I got it working, I moved on other steps
-I started styling the CSS

Unsolved Problems
-----------------

- When the user enter the word and there is a blank space, I would like to make the underline element not to show up.
- If the user gets the word rihgt, I would like to display " you are the winner"
- I would like to track the score for both users. Whoever get 3 scores first, will be the winner.
- I would like to add some kind of timer to remind the user that how many lifes they have left.
